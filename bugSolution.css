To fix this, we increase the specificity of the green style.  Here's the corrected CSS:

```css
.container button {
  background-color: green;
}

button {
  background-color: blue; /* This rule is now overridden by the more specific rule */
}
```
By making the selector more specific to target button elements within the .container, the green background color takes precedence.
